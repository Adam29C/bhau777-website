    title: ` WHERE TO GO FOR SATTA MATKA ONLINE FOR REAL MONEY`,
    descri:
      `   Satta is not currently legal in India, but it is still big business. Lotteries have become more attractive online because they combine all lotteries on an international level, so those  from India can leverage their bets by only picking lottery cards where the jackpot is the biggest. India has a relatively small lottery jackpot while the US and EU countries have jackpots  commonly in the 100’s of millions of Euros/USD. For other betting games, a large majority of Indians are still betting with local  bookies, but more are using the internet at online casinos and online bookies like Betway for cricket and other sports or casino games.`,

      `  To win at Matka Satta, you have various rate payouts, ranging from   9/1 to 999/1. You can bet on the chance of all numbers coming up to the first, last, or any other type of bet allowed by the Matka   gambling bookie. For this reason, it can be an attractive game   because of the payout multiples, but the game is merely a game ofchance and therefore can not be beaten.

    title: `SATTA MATKA FEES &amp; ODDS`,
    descri:
      `The Satta betting agent should only take a maximum of 5% of your wager amount assuming you win. Because the game is all luck and neither the agent nor the bettor has an advantage, the bookie should take home 5% on every Rupee wagered. Heavy betting on a  certain number or combination of numbers can be a dangerous  scenario. If those numbers come up, it is very likely your bookie will vanish because he can’t afford to cover the wagers. When thecards and numbers are picked, generally at 9 PM and 12 at night the winners are declared. This is how a payout would occur.`,
